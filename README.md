# Phase_4

1. Download PyCharm, Flask, the database, and the stored procedures phase III document.
2. Run the database "cs4400_sams_phase3_database_v0 (1).sql" on MySQL, then the stored procedures "cs4400_sams_phase3_stored_procedures_team87.sql" on MySQL, and then the app.py on PyCharm.
3. We used Flask to create the app, and because several of our team members have taken CS2340, we used a public GitHub repository to share and edit our code. 
5. Naya and Mark did the backend coding and testing, and Faris and Maria did the frontend coding.
